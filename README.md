# spire - The TF2 Log Aggregator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/IAmThermite/spire.svg?token=tYGRow3LJU7tP9shdaEU&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/IAmThermite/spire)

## What is this?

There is no way to view all the data from all the matches you have played over the years.
Lets fix that. You can upload logs from matches, pugs, whatever, and they will be collated into various combined logs to show your all time and official/match stats.


## Features

Upload your logs, pugs, scrims, matches, whatever, and see your stats compiled for each class and for all time.
Compare your stats with stats from different players and find out who is better.
Use the API to generate cool stream graphics or something (thinking something like [this](https://youtu.be/e4XoXiM1nX4?t=675))


## Upcoming features

### Track stat changes

For each log I calculate how much your stats change so can work out if you are getting any better. Plan is to do a weekly/monthly summary to see how much you have improved.
Even just tracking changes as you upload logs is cool.

### Rankings

I could work out who the best player for each class/division/whatever is, I could work out who could make a 'super team'.

### League vs League Data

I could work out which league as the best talent, who would win lan before it even begins.

### Global Data

[Sean](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002921833/) has some awesome stats on his [website](https://ozfstats.seanecoffey.com/) that I could potentially replicate. Probably not as well though

### Other Features

I have a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/6c3awhpH/spire) to keep track of random ideas and progress on features.
Feel free to contact me on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profile/76561198118389766/) or Discord (Themite#5512) if you have a massive brain idea.
